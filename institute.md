![Summer AI Institute Offered June 1-2 2033](/assets/banner_v2.png)

Thanks to support from theÂ [Institute of Data Science](https://ids.olemiss.edu), the [Department of Writing and Rhetoric](https://rhetoric.olemiss.edu) at the University of Mississippi offerend a unique, paid training opportunity for faculty at the University of Mississippi during the summer of 2023. Eighteen faculty members attended a two-day summer institute in early June, where they learned from colleagues about incorporating generative AI, like ChatGPT, into their courses.

This training was specifically tailored to faculty of writing-intensive and speech courses. This first summer program serves as a pilot to assess the skills and needs of faculty interested in teaching with this emerging technology.

By participating in the AI summer institute, faculty members can expect:

- Enhanced awareness, knowledge, and skills in AI and information literacy

- Professional development to improve teaching skills by exploring the benefits and risks posed by generative AI in education

- Practical exercises to deepen understanding and explore generative writing, research, and reading tools and techniques for developing AI solutions in education

Interested in collaborating with us to host an AI workshop of your own? [Contact us!](mailto:hello@mississippi.ai). In the meantime, feel free to enroll in and explore the open, asynchornous version of the workshop course. A word of caution: it's rough around the edges, and you may come across broken links and typographical errors:
