Thanks to support from theÂ Institute of Data Science, the Department of Writing and Rhetoric at the University of Mississippi will offer a unique, paid training opportunity for faculty at the University of Mississippi during the summer of 2023. Eighteen faculty members will attend a two-day summer institute in early June, where they will learn from colleagues about incorporating generative AI, like ChatGPT, into their courses.

This training is specifically tailored to faculty of writing-intensive and speech courses. The DWR welcomes applications from faculty across campus. Participating faculty will build AI literacy, and this first summer program will serve as a pilot to assess the skills and needs of faculty interested in teaching with this emerging technology.

By participating in the AI summer institute, faculty members can expect:

Enhanced awareness, knowledge, and skills in AI and information literacy

Professional development to improve teaching skills by exploring the benefits and risks posed by generative AI in education

Practical exercises to deepen understanding and explore generative writing, research, and reading tools and techniques for developing AI solutions in education
