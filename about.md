# About the Mississippi AI Institute

The Mississippi AI Institute was founded in Spring 2023 by faculty members in the Department of Writing and Rhetoric at the Unviersity of Mississippi to help their colleagues navigate the rapidly-changing world of Generative AI. The first Summer AI Institute had 23 participants from across the University of Mississippi campus and was widely praised as a successful workshop.
